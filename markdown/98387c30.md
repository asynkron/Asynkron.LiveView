# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Yes, I can talk to live-view! I have several capabilities:

## What I Can Do with Live-View

- **Create content**: Show markdown content in the live view
- **Update content**: Append to or replace existing content
- **List content**: See all markdown entries
- **View content**: Read specific content by File ID
- **Remove content**: Delete content when no longer needed
- **Chat**: Subscribe to and receive chat messages from the UI

## Current Repository

You're currently in: `/Users/rogerjohansson/git/asynkron/Asynkron.LiveView`

This appears to be the Asynkron.LiveView repository itself! 

Would you like me to:
- Show you information about this repository?
- Demonstrate more live-view features?
- Help you with something specific?
