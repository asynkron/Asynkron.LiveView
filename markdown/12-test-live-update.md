# ðŸ”¥ Live Update Test

This file was created to test live WebSocket notifications!

## Current Time
Created at: $(date)

## Test Status
- [x] File created
- [x] Live update should appear automatically
- [x] No page refresh needed

This should appear in the browser immediately via WebSocket!

## Update Test
This line was added by modifying the existing file. If you can see this, then file modification updates are working!

## Second Update Test 
ðŸŽ‰ **FIXED!** This is the second modification test after implementing `on_modified` event handler. If you can see this update appear live in the browser, then the WebSocket notifications are now working for file modifications!
