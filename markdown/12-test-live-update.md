# Live Update Test - Fix Verification

This file was created **after** the fix to verify that:

## Working Features âœ…

- **Markdown parsing**: Using self-contained parser instead of "nonsense"
- **WebSocket connectivity**: Real-time updates working
- **Status indicator**: Shows connection status properly
- **File detection**: New files trigger updates immediately

## Code Example

```python
def test_markdown_fix():
    """Test the fixed markdown rendering"""
    return "Success! No more 'nonsense' output"
```

## Mermaid Diagram Test

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Broken State] --> B[Fixed Parser]
    B --> C[Working System]
    C --> D[Happy Users]
```

**Result**: ðŸŽ‰ System is now fully functional!
