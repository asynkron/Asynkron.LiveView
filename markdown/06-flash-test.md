# Flash Effect Test

ðŸ”¥ This file was created to test the **flash animation effect** when new content arrives!

## Test Results

- File created at: `$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")`
- Should appear at the **top** of the page due to newest-first ordering
- Content area should **flash/fade in** with yellow animation

## Mermaid Test

Here's a quick diagram to test Mermaid rendering:

```mermaid

    A[New File] --> B[Flash Effect]
    B --> C[User Notices]
    C --> D[Success!]
```

> **Expected**: This content should appear with a yellow flash animation! ðŸŽ¯
