# ðŸŽ‰ Final Demo - Live Update Working!

This file was just created to demonstrate the **live update functionality** in action!

## What Just Happened?

2. âœ… **Auto-Detection**: The file watcher detected the new file immediately  
3. âœ… **WebSocket Push**: Server pushed the update to connected browser clients
4. âœ… **Live Rendering**: Browser automatically re-rendered without refresh

## System Performance
